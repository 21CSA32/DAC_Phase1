# Techniques Used to Analyze Water Quality

**Physical Examination:**
- **Color and Turbidity:** Visual inspection for color and turbidity can provide information about the presence of suspended particles and impurities in the water.

**Chemical Analysis:**
- **pH Measurement:** pH levels indicate the water's acidity or alkalinity, which can affect the solubility of contaminants.
- **Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD):** Measures the amount of oxygen required for the oxidation of organic and inorganic matter in water, indicating pollution levels.
- **Dissolved Oxygen (DO):** Measures the amount of oxygen dissolved in water, which is crucial for aquatic life.
- **Nutrient Analysis:** Measures the levels of nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus, which can lead to eutrophication and algal blooms.

**Biological Assessment:**
- **Biotic Index:** Uses the presence and abundance of specific aquatic organisms as indicators of water quality. Certain species are sensitive to pollution.

**Molecular Biology Techniques:**
- **Remote Sensing:** Uses satellite or aerial imagery to monitor water quality indicators like water temperature, algae blooms, and sediment plumes in large water bodies.

**Microbiological Analysis:**
- **Coliform Bacteria Testing:** Detects the presence of coliform bacteria, which can indicate fecal contamination and the potential presence of pathogens.
- **Fecal Coliform or E. coli Testing:** More specific tests for fecal contamination.
